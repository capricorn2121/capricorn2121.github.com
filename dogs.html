	<h2>Hi! This website is about dogs, how they have affected our society in the past, and how they continue to affect our society today.<br> </h2>
	<h3 id ="prehistory">The prehistoric era</h3>
	<h4>During prehistoric times, dogs were still wolves. But these wolves had a connection with humans. After the humans finished eating their food, they would leave a scrap pile. <br> 
	The wolves would go to the scrap pile, and they would eat the leftovers. Over time, these wolves and humans developed a close relationship. Those wolves eventually evolved into dogs.  </h4>
	
	<h3 id = "bronze">The Bronze Age</h3>
	<h4>Lots of tombs and caves dating back to the Bronze age contain statues or pictures of dogs. Some prehistoric pictures show dogs on a leash.  This
	shows that dogs were already pets during the bronze age. </h4>

	<h3 id = "greeks/romans"> The Ancient Greeks/Romans </h3>
	<h4> The ancient Greeks and Romans liked dogs, because of their faithfulness and courage. In the ancient Greek epic Odyssey, Odysseus had a dog named Argos, and when Odysseus returned home after his <br> journey, Argos was the only one who recognized him. Dogs were also kept as pets, and they were popular gifts for friends or family members.
The Ancient Romans kept 3 types of dogs, hunting dogs, war <br> dogs, and lap dogs. Hunting dogs were used for tracking animals, war dogs were large dogs that were used in attack formations, and lap dogs were kept as pets or for companions.

Dogs were commonly <br> displayed on tapestries depicting hunting.Pictures of people hunting with dogs would symbolize the person was a noble men. Servants and peasants were not allowed to go hunting. 
Dogs were also put <br> into lots of coats of arms, because they represented courage and faithfulness. There are lots of specific breeds put into coats of arms, like white hounds (which are found in several coats of arms from England ).
